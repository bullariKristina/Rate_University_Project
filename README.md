Rate University Application 
1. The Problem
  It should be possible for students to give feedback and rate the courses they attend. This will improve the quality of the courses in the future and also help students choose the courses to register
based on the feedback given by previous students.

3. Scenario
   Ben, is studying computer science at UPT. He needs to find information about available courses. Based on the information and course schedule, Ben can find the courses that he is interested in. Ben
wants to be sure before registering for a course and he reads all recent feedback (description and rating) given for a specific course by students who attended the course before. He is mostly
interested in top-rated courses since he believes he will get more benefits from them. Ben wants also to leave feedback for courses he attended recently so that he can share his experience with other students.
